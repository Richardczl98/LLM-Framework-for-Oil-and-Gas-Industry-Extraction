sand had been flooded. In some of the wells, however, perforations above this level were found to be watered out, suggesting fingering, channeling or leaks. A water control diagnostic12 of the wells shows that some of them were experiencing high permeability multi-layer channeling. Figures 8 and 9 show the log-log plot of WOR and WORâ€™ versus time for wells LL-553 and LL-318 respectively. 
 The actual location of the waterflood front was therefore determined from production data. Producing wells with more than 90% watercut and oil production rates of 50 stb per day were designated as water flooded wells. Wells with producing gas oil ratio (Rp) greater than 5,000 scf/stb were designated as gassed out wells. Non-producing wells, which had been closed because of high sand production or mechanical problems, were filtered out. The watercut and producing gas oil ratio data in the few months before shut in were used to classify the wells. 
  Figures 10 to 14 show the watercut trends across the reservoir from 1980 to 1999. The water fingers are very clear and tended to drift northwards from the injector wells. Figure 15 shows a permeability map while Figure 16 shows the front of the waterflood in 1997. An overlay of the permeability map and the watercut maps as shown in Figure 17 indicate that the movement of the waterflood front and the fingers occurred along the most permeable zones. There exist a very good match between the zones of high permeability and the area swept by the advancing flank waterflood front. 
The Impact of the Flank Waterflooding. 
The flank waterflooding had an impact on the drive mechanism, producing gas oil ratio, fluid production rates and average reservoir pressure. A material balance of the reservoir shows that in 1984, fluid expansion was responsible for 31.25% of the reservoir energy while pore volume compressibility and water influx were responsible for 35% and 33.75% respectively. By December 1999, the share of reservoir energy by fluid expansion had fallen to 10.6% while water injection accounted for 29%. Pore volume compressibility and water influx accounted for 22.4% and 38% respectively. Figure 18 show the change in the drive mechanism for the reservoir from 1926 to 1999. 
The producing gas oil ratio remained stable at 600 scf/stb until 1984 when the waterflood began. Then, it increased to about 1,600 scf/stb in 1990. This seems to indicate that the injected water was not replacing the reservoir void. The producing gas oil ratio decreased after 1990 signifying perhaps that fillup was occurring. Figure 19 shows a straight-line plot of the cumulative total fluid versus the cumulative water injected. The slope further supports the hypothesis that fillup was taking place during this period.13 
The flank waterflooding also increased oil production, The average oil production rate dropped from 40,000 stb 
per day in 1984 to 27,500 stb per day in 1992 as a result of the watering out and shut in of some perforations in the La Rosa and Lagunillas Inferior units. The execution of a repair and recompletion program, following a review of the waterflood, increased daily oil production rates. By 1999, the rate had increased to 50,000 stb per day. One of the principal objectives of the latest integrated study of the reservoir was therefore to determine how much of the increased oil production could be attributed to the flank waterflooding. 14, 15, 16 
The Net Gain from the Flank Waterflooding. 
Using decline analysis, the remaining oil reserves (1999-2019) was 198.2 million bbls. The oil displaced from the water bank zone prior to and after the waterflooding can be determined with the aid of reservoir performance predictions. Using decline analysis techniques, as shown in Figures 20 and 21, the net oil gain by the flank waterflooding was 16.9 million bbls (1984-1999). A net oil gain of 160.03 million bbls is expected by 2019, if the flank waterflood is continued. This assumes that the optimal reservoir efficiency is maintained by keeping a balance between withdrawal and voidage replacement fluid rates in the reservoir.  
The primary oil recovery is 36.7% based on the reservoir performance predictions. The flank waterflood contributes a secondary recovery of 3.8%. The total ultimate recovery (2019) is therefore 40.5%. On the basis of these results and the location of the present OWC, the shifting of the injection line northwards is recommended. Four more injection wells near the present OWC are recommended. The water injection rates are to be optimized to maintain a balance with fluid withdrawal. The injection wells are to be located so that the volumetric sweep efficiency would be optimized and the fingering reduced. Re-perforations are recommended above the present OWC wherever possible. The watered out zones are recommended for abandonment. 
Conclusions. 
The potential benefit of the flank waterflooding in the Lagunillas reservoir is 4% of the initial oil in place. The net oil gain during the 1984-1999 period was 17 million bbls. The waterflood front showed fingering due to reservoir heterogeneity. The waterflood front moved more rapidly in high permeability zones. The production data was used to determine the actual movement of the waterbank front. A new set of injection wells, nearer the present oil water contact, is recommended. A net oil gain of 160 million bbls is expected from the flank waterflood by 2019.
