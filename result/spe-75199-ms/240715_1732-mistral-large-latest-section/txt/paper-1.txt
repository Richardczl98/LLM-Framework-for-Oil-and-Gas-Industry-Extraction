Abstract 
The Lagunillas 07 reservoir is located Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. The reservoir contains the Laguna, Lagunillas and La Rosa formations. The sands are of the Miocene age, poorly consolidated, well sorted and fine-grained. The oil had an 18º API and a viscosity of 21 cp at initial conditions. Oil production began in 1926 and more than 1,000 wells have been drilled. Flank waterflooding, at an average water injection rate of 100,000 stb per day, was introduced for pressure maintenance purposes in 1984. By December 1999, cumulative water injected was 558 million barrels and 36.7 % of the initial oil in place had been produced. 
This paper evaluates the impact of the flank waterflooding project in the Lagunillas 07 reservoir. The net oil recovery due to the flank waterflooding is estimated. The real time water front movement is determined with a front-tracking technique that uses fluid production data. The movement shows water fingering due to reservoir heterogeneity. A good match is obtained when the water front movement is cross-correlated with the petrophysical properties of the reservoir. Finally, the impact of the flank waterflooding on recovery factor is highlighted. 
The paper concludes that a net oil recovery of 17 million barrels can be attributed to the flank waterflooding from 1984 to 1999. A net oil recovery of 160 million barrels is expected if the flank waterflooding is continued until 2019. The flank waterflooding is therefore considered a success. A future development plan is proposed for the reservoir. 
Introduction 
The Lagunillas 07 reservoir is made up of an arch structure with an average strike of 300o and a southwest dip of 3o to 3.5o . The average sand thickness is 86 ft. The reservoir consists of 3 units with cross flow and good vertical communication. The units are the Laguna, the Lagunillas Inferior and the La Rosa. The Laguna and the Lagunillas Inferior units consist of fluvio-deltaic sediments. There is sand continuity in both units. The Laguna unit pinches out to the northeast and is more complex with thinner, less continuous sands. The Lagunillas Inferior unit contains the best oil sands and accounts for about 90% of all initial oil in place. The La Rosa unit is mainly marine and is more heterogeneous with less oil sands.1 
The first well was drilled in 1926. Early production data was of poor quality. Subsidence data were not taken until 1940 although surface subsidence due to rock compaction had occurred earlier. Rock property data were obtained from 2 core analysis studies. Average porosity was 30% and connate water saturation was 16%. The reservoir temperature was 152 oF. 
Field Production and Injection History 
Oil production began in 1926 and reached a daily peak of 115,000 stock tank barrels (stb) per day in 1937. It fell to an average of 63,000 stb per day between 1938 and 1958 despite the installation of artificial lift to improve productivity due to pressure depletion. After 1958, the production rate became market dependent. It steadily declined to a low level of 16,000 stb per day in 1972. New infill wells were drilled and the oil production rate increased to 49,000 stb per day. The average reservoir pressure declined by more than 50% between 1926 and 1980. This decline prompted a study to determine the best pressure maintenance method.2 A flank waterflood was recommended by the study. The flank waterflooding was initiated in 1984.  Figure 1 shows the daily oil production and the watercut. The watercut was in the 15% to 20% range between 1944 and 1984. It increased to 55% in 1998 as a result of the flank waterflooding. 
The water injection rate averaged about 100,000 stb per day from 1984 to 1996 as shown in Figure 2. It
