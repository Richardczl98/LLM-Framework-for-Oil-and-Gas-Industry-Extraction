ranged from 100,000 stb per day to 150,000 stb per day between 1996 and 1999. Fifteen injector wells were drilled in the southern part of the reservoir in 1984. But, only 12 of the wells were active. The waterflooding was aimed at maintaining reservoir pressure by enhancing the energy of the natural aquifer water influx. Cumulative water injected by December 1999 was 549 million barrels. 
Pressure History 
The initial pressure of the reservoir was 1785 psia at a datum of 3,700 feet subsea. The reservoir was initially undersaturated. Bubble point pressure was 1,154 psia. Figures 3 shows the plot of average reservoir pressure vs. time. The average reservoir pressure at a datum of 3,700 ft.ss. declined exponentially from 1,785 psia in 1926 to 788 psia in 1980. The pressure was distributed unevenly areally in the reservoir due to the reservoir exploitation schemes and the absence of deep water drilling technology. In 1936, the average reservoir pressure ranged between 1200 psia and 1,700 psia with the pressure increasing westward. The average reservoir pressure increased from 753 psia in 1984 to 950 psia in 1999 in response to the water injection. 
Figures 4 to 7 show the pressure distribution (isobar) maps for the reservoir in 1984, 1990, 1995 and 1998. The most dramatic increase occurred in the southern part of the reservoir near the injection wells. The general increase in pressure near the injection wells was not uniform as could be seen in the 1990 isobar map in Figure 5. Some of the wells near the injector wells did not experience as much of a general increase in pressure as other wells that were much further away. This could be attributed of the uneven areal pressure communication in the reservoir due to the reservoir heterogeneity. Despite this, the flank waterflooding seems to have achieved its main objective of maintaining the reservoir pressure. 
Petrophysical Evaluation. 
 The petrophysical evaluation of the Lagunillas 07 reservoir is based on the analysis of 1176 wells and two cores of combined length of 390 feet in the Lagunillas Formation. Detailed log-core correlations were conducted and were based on conventional and special core analysis, detailed sedimentilogical description of the core and X-Ray diffraction analysis of core samples. The Lagunillas Formation lithologically is comprised of interbedded sandstones and shales. The sandstone facies are predominantly medium to fine grained varying in porosity range from 26-32% and 6-11% respectively. Some bioturbation is present in the medium grained facies. The matrix is predominantly quartz with detrital potassium feldspars and metamorphic fragments. 
 The petrophysical parameters tortuosity factor (a), cementation exponent (m) and desaturation exponent (n) were derived directly from core analysis and 
confirmed by log crossplot analysis. Formation water resistivities (Rw) were derived from formation water analysis and confirmed by Rwa analysis in 30 wells that intersected a clearly defined OWC. 
    A sensibility study was carried out on Simandoux and Indonesia water saturation models. The later proved to be a better fit when compared to production data and was used exclusively in the petrophysical evaluation. Permeability (K) prediction in the reservoir was achieved by direct correlation of conventional core results and log results to produce a function of the type 
Log (K)  = A* φ + B ……………………………………(1) 
where A and B  are constants. Permeability prediction by the above equation was confirmed by the excellent overlay with the advance of the water front fingers.

the reservoir injection efficiency was calculated to be 89.5%. The outer radius of the oil bank was 7,828 meters while that of the water bank radius was 2,939 meters as of December 1999. These results were based on an average water saturation of 63% behind the waterfront, a connate water saturation of 16%, an initial gas saturation of 6.6% and a volumetric swept efficiency of 62.6%. 
Water fingering is due to the effect of properties such as mobility ratio and permeability variation. Methods for tracking a waterflood front include taking the difference between successive seismic surveys7, integrated genetic facies modeling 8, oil water contact (OWC) movement 9 , transient pressure intepretation10, and production logging intepretation11. In the absence of successive seismic surveys and integrated genetic facies modeling, the void replacement movement was used to calculate the OWC movement. At initial conditions, the OWC contact was only available in a few wells.  
  Using regression analysis, the relationship between the top of the reservoir and the original OWC was represented by the equation 
OOWC = 1.036465 (TOP) + 182.94993 …………….(5) 
This equation had an R2 adjusted of 99.1%. By 1999, voidage replacement showed that 32.2ft of the net oil
