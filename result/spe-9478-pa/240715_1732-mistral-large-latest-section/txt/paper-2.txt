total acre feet: the Chubbee, 2C, 3C, and 3E. 
The Hewitt structure contoured on the Chubbee is shown in Fig. 3. It is a northwest-to-southeast trending anticline with a 12° dip to the west and south. The pro­ductive limits of the field are bounded by water/oil con­tacts to the west, south, and southeast, by a major fault to the north, and by steep dip and faulting to the east. Fig. 4 shows a plat of the unit with the water/oil contacts of the major sands. Most of the 22 sands contain water/oil contacts, and they occur at about the same subsea elevation. Moving from low to high on the struc­ture, the number of sands within the oil column in­creases, and inside Zone 3E productive limit a maximum net sand thickness of up to 225 ft (68.6 m) occurs. 
Waterflood Development 
Exxon began evaluating Hewitt as a waterflood prospect in the mid-1950's. As the major acreage owner, Exxon did most of the geological and engineering work during negotiations with 47 other operators. A summary of the unit's reservoir data is shown in Table 1. 
The waterflood was developed in three stages (Fig. 5). Initial flooding began in 1969 in the southern and southwest portions. This portion of the field was favored because of the structurally lower position of the sands 
and the anticipated higher oil saturations caused by gravity drainage. In addition, the south end was closer to a source water supply. By the end of 1970, the north half of Section 22, all of Section 9, and the top of Section 16 were under flood. The final exansion occurred in 1971, when 600 acres (2 428 124 m f) were added in Sections 10 and 15, and the balance of Section 16. 
The flood pattern is a 20-acre (80 937-m2) five-spot with some irregularities. The unit drilled 53 of the 147 active producers and 86 of the 142 active injectors, with the balance being older primary wells brought into the unit. These old wells were utilized as much as possible to minimize costs. Many new wells and major workovers of old wells were necessary to provide cemented casing strings for injection wells. Flood development included the plugging of 680 wells. Plugging costs total $4,500,000 or approximately 25 % of the flood develop­ment cost. The total waterflood investment of $18,500,000 was paid out in 1974. 
Ninety-two of the 147 producing wells are equipped with electric submersible pumps and the other 55 are conventional rod pumps. Production is monitored through a central tank battery. Initially source water was supplied by five wells completed in a 1,200-ft (366-m) saltwater sand 8 miles (12.9 km) south of the unit. Cur-
