Case Study of a Multiple Sand Waterflood, Hewitt Unit, OK

Summary 
Twenty-two sands in the Hewitt field have been flooded simultaneously by Exxon Co. U.S.A.'s Hewitt Unit, and a case history of the operations is detailed in this paper. A multiple sand waterflood project requires special op­timization methods to improve oil recovery. Injection and production surveillance programs and optimization methods used are highlighted. These include injection wellbore design, injection distribution, production stimulation, polymer augmented injection, and infill drilling. Successful application of these techniques has increased ultimate recovery from this waterflood operation. 
Introduction 
Hewitt Unit is located 20 miles (32.2 km) west of Ard­more in south central Oklahoma and covers approx­imately 2,600 acres (10.52 km2) (Fig. 1). The Unit became effective March 1, 1968, for the purpose of con­ducting a waterflood in 22 separate Pennsylvanian-age sands. 
Currently the unit has 147 active producinf wells and 142 active injectors on a 20-acre (80 937-m ) five-spot pattern with each productive sand open in the wellbore. All zones are commingled in the producers, and a total of 419 individual injection strings provide waterflood sup­port. The unitized production peaked at 14,000 BOPD (2226 m3 Id oil) in Jan. 1973 and has declined to a cur­rent level of 4,500 BOPD (715 m3 /d oil). Injection rates were as high as 200,000 BWPD (31 797 m3 /d water) but have been reduced to a current level of 160,000 BWPD (25 438 m 3 /d water). 
Primary Production 
Hewitt, one of the oldest fields in Oklahoma, was discovered in 1919. Development was rapid during the 1920's, with primary production peaking at 27,000 BOPD (4293 m3 /d oil) in 1921. The spacing was erratic, with approximately 1,000 wells drilled for an average of 2.5 acres (10 117 m2) per well.

In the early days completion was accomplished by drilling through the first major producing zone and run­ning slotted production casing across the producing in­terval. Cemented casing was the exception rather than the rule. After production had declined, the well was deepened through the next major interval and smaller slotted casing was run to total depth. This procedure was repeated in many instances. Initially all casing was hung from the surface and, later, upper portions of the multistrings were salvaged, leaving uncemented slotted liners. 
Hewitt was a prolific field producing 98.5 MMbbl (15.6x 106 m3) before unitization, or an average of 37,800 bbl/acre (1.485 m3/m2). After49 years of life, operations had declined to the stripper stage and several hundred wells had been shut down or abandoned. Pro­duction before unitization was 2,700 BOPD (429 m3 /d oil) from 600 active wells, or 4.5 BOPD (0.7 m 3 Id oil) per well. The average decline in production was 4% per year, and some leases had a projected life beyond the year 2000. 
Recovery was principally by solution-gas drive augmented by gravity drainage on downstructure leases. Water/oil contacts were to the south, southeast, and west of the field, but no active water drive was present. Gas caps were present initially in some sands, but no effec­tive gas drive was realized because the gas caps were dissipated rapidly during early development. 
Geology 
The geologic section and nomenclature adopted in iden­tifying individual sands is shown on a type log (Fig. 2). The section is a sand/shale sequence of the Hoxbar and Deese formation of Pennsylvanian age. Gross interval between the top and lowermost sands is 1,500 to 1,600 ft (457 to 488 m). The average depth of the sands ranges from 1,200 to 2,900 ft (365 to 844 m) subsurface. The pay interval is divided into five major zones, the first Hewitt through the fifth. The sands within a zone are termed A, B, etc., with the exception of the Steams and Chubbee at the top. Four sands comprise 73 % of the
