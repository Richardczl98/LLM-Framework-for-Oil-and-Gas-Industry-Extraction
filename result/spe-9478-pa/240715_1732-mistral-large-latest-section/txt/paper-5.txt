prevent a more depleted oil sand from flooding out a less depleted sand in the commingled producing well. Fluid levels are monitored on a regular basis in ali producing wells in the field. The wells with a high fluid level are considered for the possibility of a decrease in offset in­jection. Conversely, low fluid level producers that potentially could benefit from injection increases are identified. The producing sand cumulative throughput of water and corresponding oil reserves are analyzed for the potential of injection changes. 
During 1975 and 1976 several injection cutbacks were used to decrease injection into high water-cut sand_s. The first injection cutback, in Oct. 1975, amounted to 12,000 BID (1908 m3/d) in the Chubbee, and was followed by an increase in production of approximately 200 BOPD (31.8 m3/d oil). The other two injection cutbacks were begun in Sept. and Nov. 1976 and totaled 17,800 BID (2830 m3/d). These injection decreases lowered injec­tion costs while oil production remained unchanged. The decreases in injection did not alter the field decline but successfully lowered fluid levels. Fig. 8 shows produc­tion levels during 1976 following the injection cutback. 
In the second half of 1977 the field decline began to change from a 24 % per year rate to a 1980 decline rate of 12% per year. Selective injection increases were in­itiated in June 1977 and are credited as a principal reason for the gradual shift in field decline. A total increase of 12,250 BWPD (1948 m3 /d water) has been implemented to date. Fig. 9 shows an example of the effect of selec-
tive injection increases into less depleted sands during 1977-80. As shown, the injection increase in Section 15 resulted in increased oil production of as much as 350 BOPD (56 m3/d oil). 
Polymer Treatments 
The Hewitt Unit has had three polymer-augmented injec­tion projects. The projects have involved the injection of a high molecular weight, water-soluble polyacrylamide that becomes gelatinous when mixed with water. A cross-linking agent is injected, and this activates the polyacrylamide to form a viscous gel. The material will enter the most permeable section of the sand and build up yield Strength to block and/or divert flow. The resulting pressure buildup diverts the injection water to less permeable flow channels that are less depleted and con­tain a higher oil saturation. This diversion of injection water improves the vertical sweep efficiency of the flood. 
A map of three polymer project areas is shown in Fig. 10, and a summary of the three projects is presented in Table 3. Each of the projects injected polymer into the Chubbee sand, one of the four major unit sands. Treatments were sized to inject polymer at a 500-ppm concentration for 30 days. The objective was to increase injection wellhead pressure to as near plant injection pressure [1,080 psig (7445 kPa)] as possible while main­taining a constant rate of injection water. This increase in pressure indicates plugging of the most permeable
