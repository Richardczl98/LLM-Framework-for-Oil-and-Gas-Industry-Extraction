Answer every question independently and it shall not be affected by other questions. DO NOT ignore or omit any questions, ALL questions need to be answered even if you cannot extract. Follow the instruction to answer if you cannot extract. Answer every question only once, and do not repeat the answer multiple times. Ensure every answer is on a separate row. 
We always ask you to answer in the following format: {key:value unit@reference page and reference content}. Please note for some questions, only value exsit, and unit does not exsit. If unit exsit, make sure only one space between the "value" and the "unit". Always output the curly braces, which enclose the answer; do not add punctuation or any extra text outside of the curly braces; and we rely on the curly braces to seperate and parse the answer. Within the curly braces, text before ":" is the key we use to recognize the question. The key should be kept exactly as it is. Text after ":" and before "@" is the value and unit (if exsit) of the key or what we ask you to extract from the papers. Text after "@" is reference page and reference content that let us know where the answer comes from. When user asks "reference page and reference content", user wants to know the reference you used to reasoning about the answer. It is not ask you to output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". Save the reference text (not line numbers) from which you extracted the answer to "reference content"; and save the reference text's page number to "reference page". Make sure to keep the reference text under 60 words, as we have limited output space. Ignore any line breakers in reference text, and output them as a single line. When you cannot extract the answer, please only output as required, which is usually {key:not_mentioned} and do not need to give any explanations. "reference page and reference content" is specific for every question, so work on it every time when you answer a question. 
Here is an example: The reference text says "the Oska field's oil production volume is 23 bbl/day" in page 1  , and user ask what is the Oil production volume for the Oska field? you should answer in the following format: {Oil production volume:23 bbl/day@page 1 the Oska field's oil production volume is 23 bbl/day}. 
This is the start of a question. This question can not be skipped, please answer it. After answering this question, go ahead to answer the next question if it exists.You need to replace reference page and reference content properly as required every time you answer a question and follow all format requirements. Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". Please extract the country where Hewitt Unit is located, based on the above reference text. If you do not find country directly, but can find the state or province, you may use your knowledge to answer the country. For example, if it is located in California, you may answer the United States of Amercia; if it is located in Heilongjiang, you may answer China. If you find a country, save it to "value". Then output {Field location (Country):value@Reference page and referece content}, Please note "Field location (Country)" in the above {} before : is the key, and do not put your answer here. You should put answer to "value" in the above {}. If you do not find country, answer {Field location (Country):not_mentioned}.

Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". From the above reference text, extract field age. Field age is defined as the number of years that have passed since the Hewitt Unit Field initially started its production of oil or gas, up to the year of 2023. Please note we are not interested in when the field was discovered, but need to know the actual year of start of oil (or gas) production. You also need to a simple calculation. For example, if the first production was in 2000, the field age is 2023 - 2000 = 23. Please make sure to use the year of first production to caculate. For example, if you encounter text like "this field has been steamflooded for 20 years", You should not extract 20 years as the field age, because steamflooding could be only part of the production, not the entire part. If you are able to extract the field age, please answer {Field age:value@Reference page and refrence content}. Otherwise, please answer {Field age:not_mentioned}. 
This is the start of a question. This question can not be skipped, please answer it.

Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". From the above reference text, if you can extract field depth of Hewitt Unit, answer {Field depth:value unit@reference page and reference content}. Otherwise, answer {Field depth:not_mentioned}. Please use the following guidance: 1. field depth is not the well depth. Do not confuse them. Well depth is the actual depth of a particular well, while field depth is the depth of the average or typical depth range at which the gas/oil-bearing formations are found within a specific gas/oil field.

Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". From the above reference text, extract the number of oil production volume of Hewitt Unit. If we ask you oil production volume in a particular year,it does not mean you have to give the volume for the entire year. If you can just extract the oil production volume in any period of that year, that is what we need. For example, you can extract 23 bbl/day from text like "the oil production volume is 23 bbl/day at the begining of the year". If you can extract, provide the "value" and "unit" in the format of {Oil production volume:value unit@Reference page and content}. If the oil production volume is not in a specific time, but in an accumulated period, give out the answer in the format of {Oil production volume:value unit within the accumulated period@Reference page and content}. For example, extract or summarize "23 million barrels since the inception of the oil field" if it is expressed in the referece text. Make sure always follow the format requirement.If you were not able to extracte a number in a specific time or within an accumulated period, answer {Oil production volume:not_mentioned}. Please note that oil production volume is NOT the recoverable reserves estimation. It's the volume that has been produced.
This is the start of a question. This question can not be skipped, please answer it.

Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". From the above reference text, extract the number of producing wells of Hewitt Unit. Always answer in the numeral form, such as 8 instead of eight. If you encounter any text like "six out of eight producing well", the answer is 8. Do not output 6 or "six out of eight". What we need is the total number. Do not extract standalone numbers when they are part of a phrase indicating a range. For example, avoid extracting "1000" when it is used within the phrase "more than 1000" Instead, extract the entire phrase "more than 1000". Similarly, avoid extracting "1000" from expressions like "less than 1000". Instead, extract the entire phrase "less than 1000". Similarly, extract the entire phrase "between 1000 and 2000", which indicates a range. Ignore any context like six producing well is redrilled.Again, we need to extract the total number not the partical number. The number of redrilled producing well does not refect the total number. Please note that producing wells are sometimes called active producers or simply produers. Do not confuse well slots with the producing wells since well slots might include other type of wells, such as water injecting wells. What we need is the number of producing wells. Another example is that you can extract 10 from text like "out of 21 active wells 10 are producers and 11 are injectors". 10 is still the totoal number of producing well. 21 is the total number of wells including producers and injectors, but we do not need to extract 21.If you were able to extracte the number, answer {Number of producing wells:value@Reference page and content}. If you were not able to extracte the number, answer {Number of producing wells:not_mentioned}.

The number of redrilled water injecting well does not refect the total number.Do not extract a range number such as 1000 out of "more than 1000", as we need to extract exact number, not a range. Please note that water injecting wells are sometimes called injectors. But please make sure the injectors refer to water injecting wells, not other injectors. Do not confuse well slots with water injecting wells since well slots might include other type of wells, such as producing wells. What we need is the number of water injecting wells. Do not get confused between injecting well and injection manifolds, they are two different things. Another example is that you can extract 11 from text like "out of 21 active wells 10 are producers and 11 are injectors". 11 is still the totoal number of water injecting wells. 21 is the total number of wells including producers and injectors, but we do not need to extract 21.If you were able to extracte the number, answer {Number of water injecting wells:value@Reference page and content}. If you were not able to extracte the number, answer {Number of water injecting wells:not_mentioned}.

Case Study of a Multiple Sand Waterflood, Hewitt Unit, OK 
David B. Ruble, SPE, Exxon Co. U.S.A. 
Summary 
Twenty-two sands in the Hewitt field have been flooded simultaneously by Exxon Co. U.S.A.'s Hewitt Unit, and a case history of the operations is detailed in this paper. A multiple sand waterflood project requires special op­timization methods to improve oil recovery. Injection and production surveillance programs and optimization methods used are highlighted. These include injection wellbore design, injection distribution, production stimulation, polymer augmented injection, and infill drilling. Successful application of these techniques has increased ultimate recovery from this waterflood operation. 
Introduction 
Hewitt Unit is located 20 miles (32.2 km) west of Ard­more in south central Oklahoma and covers approx­imately 2,600 acres (10.52 km2) (Fig. 1). The Unit became effective March 1, 1968, for the purpose of con­ducting a waterflood in 22 separate Pennsylvanian-age sands. 
Currently the unit has 147 active producinf wells and 142 active injectors on a 20-acre (80 937-m ) five-spot pattern with each productive sand open in the wellbore. All zones are commingled in the producers, and a total of 419 individual injection strings provide waterflood sup­port. The unitized production peaked at 14,000 BOPD (2226 m3 Id oil) in Jan. 1973 and has declined to a cur­rent level of 4,500 BOPD (715 m3 /d oil). Injection rates were as high as 200,000 BWPD (31 797 m3 /d water) but have been reduced to a current level of 160,000 BWPD (25 438 m 3 /d water). 
Primary Production 
Hewitt, one of the oldest fields in Oklahoma, was discovered in 1919. Development was rapid during the 1920's, with primary production peaking at 27,000 BOPD (4293 m3 /d oil) in 1921. The spacing was erratic, with approximately 1,000 wells drilled for an average of 2.5 acres (10 117 m2) per well.

In the early days completion was accomplished by drilling through the first major producing zone and run­ning slotted production casing across the producing in­terval. Cemented casing was the exception rather than the rule. After production had declined, the well was deepened through the next major interval and smaller slotted casing was run to total depth. This procedure was repeated in many instances. Initially all casing was hung from the surface and, later, upper portions of the multistrings were salvaged, leaving uncemented slotted liners. 
Hewitt was a prolific field producing 98.5 MMbbl (15.6x 106 m3) before unitization, or an average of 37,800 bbl/acre (1.485 m3/m2). After49 years of life, operations had declined to the stripper stage and several hundred wells had been shut down or abandoned. Pro­duction before unitization was 2,700 BOPD (429 m3 /d oil) from 600 active wells, or 4.5 BOPD (0.7 m 3 Id oil) per well. The average decline in production was 4% per year, and some leases had a projected life beyond the year 2000. 
Recovery was principally by solution-gas drive augmented by gravity drainage on downstructure leases. Water/oil contacts were to the south, southeast, and west of the field, but no active water drive was present. Gas caps were present initially in some sands, but no effec­tive gas drive was realized because the gas caps were dissipated rapidly during early development. 
Geology 
The geologic section and nomenclature adopted in iden­tifying individual sands is shown on a type log (Fig. 2). The section is a sand/shale sequence of the Hoxbar and Deese formation of Pennsylvanian age. Gross interval between the top and lowermost sands is 1,500 to 1,600 ft (457 to 488 m). The average depth of the sands ranges from 1,200 to 2,900 ft (365 to 844 m) subsurface. The pay interval is divided into five major zones, the first Hewitt through the fifth. The sands within a zone are termed A, B, etc., with the exception of the Steams and Chubbee at the top. Four sands comprise 73 % of the

total acre feet: the Chubbee, 2C, 3C, and 3E. 
The Hewitt structure contoured on the Chubbee is shown in Fig. 3. It is a northwest-to-southeast trending anticline with a 12° dip to the west and south. The pro­ductive limits of the field are bounded by water/oil con­tacts to the west, south, and southeast, by a major fault to the north, and by steep dip and faulting to the east. Fig. 4 shows a plat of the unit with the water/oil contacts of the major sands. Most of the 22 sands contain water/oil contacts, and they occur at about the same subsea elevation. Moving from low to high on the struc­ture, the number of sands within the oil column in­creases, and inside Zone 3E productive limit a maximum net sand thickness of up to 225 ft (68.6 m) occurs. 
Waterflood Development 
Exxon began evaluating Hewitt as a waterflood prospect in the mid-1950's. As the major acreage owner, Exxon did most of the geological and engineering work during negotiations with 47 other operators. A summary of the unit's reservoir data is shown in Table 1. 
The waterflood was developed in three stages (Fig. 5). Initial flooding began in 1969 in the southern and southwest portions. This portion of the field was favored because of the structurally lower position of the sands 
and the anticipated higher oil saturations caused by gravity drainage. In addition, the south end was closer to a source water supply. By the end of 1970, the north half of Section 22, all of Section 9, and the top of Section 16 were under flood. The final exansion occurred in 1971, when 600 acres (2 428 124 m f) were added in Sections 10 and 15, and the balance of Section 16. 
The flood pattern is a 20-acre (80 937-m2) five-spot with some irregularities. The unit drilled 53 of the 147 active producers and 86 of the 142 active injectors, with the balance being older primary wells brought into the unit. These old wells were utilized as much as possible to minimize costs. Many new wells and major workovers of old wells were necessary to provide cemented casing strings for injection wells. Flood development included the plugging of 680 wells. Plugging costs total $4,500,000 or approximately 25 % of the flood develop­ment cost. The total waterflood investment of $18,500,000 was paid out in 1974. 
Ninety-two of the 147 producing wells are equipped with electric submersible pumps and the other 55 are conventional rod pumps. Production is monitored through a central tank battery. Initially source water was supplied by five wells completed in a 1,200-ft (366-m) saltwater sand 8 miles (12.9 km) south of the unit. Cur-

rently only two of the wells are maintained for makeup requirements. Produced water is treated in coalescers and sand filters before reinjection. Source water has been commingled with produced water since 1975 without any adverse effects. 
Operations 
Unit operations, shown in Fig. 6, began with injection in April 1969, and approximately 6 months later oil response occurred. Production increased steadily during 1970, to 9,000 BOPD (1431 m3/d oil), and then leveled off during the next 20 months at an average of 9,500 BOPD (1510 m3/d oil) through Aug. 1972. Response from the 1971 expansion area combined with the re­mainder of the unit to peak production at 14,000 BOPD (2226 m3 /d oil) during Jan. 1973. The unit production declined at a constant rate of 24% per year from 1974 until 1977, when the decline began to shift to the current decline rate of 12% per year. 
Water production rose rapidly along with early flood gains, and by 1972 exceeded 90,000 BID (14 309 m 3 /d) for a water cut of more than 90%. This high water-cut behavior was expected. Preunit engineering studies had predicted this type of behavior, caused primarily by permeability variation. 
Injection rose rapidly during the early development to 190,000 BID (30 208 m3/d), which is essentially plant capacity. Input remained at that level through the third quarter of 1975. The drop in injection after 1975 to the

current level of 160,000 BID (25 438 m 3 /d) was due to selective injection cutbacks discussed later under Flood Optimization. 
Cumulative withdrawals since unitization to Jan. 1, 1980, total 34 MMbbl (5 405 568 m3) of oil and 425 MMbbl (67.6x 106 m3) of water. A total of 648 MMbbl (103 x 106 m3) of water has been injected, which equates to a 1.4 reservoir pore volume throughput. 
Injection Well Design 
Initial waterflood studies indicated a large permeability variation in the sands at the Hewitt field. This, along with the large number of sands proposed to waterflood, indicated the need for injection water control to flood the field efficiently. 
Fig. 7 illustrates a triple completion used to segregate injection mechanically. Surface casing was cemented below freshwater sands, and three staggered lengths of 2Ys-in. (7.3-cm) casing then were run and cemented to the surface. The short string, or Completion A, was set through the first Hewitt sand, String B through the sec­ond sand, and String C included the third, fourth, and fifth sands. Each completion string was perforated to in­clude at least one of the four major sands (Chubbee, 2C, 3C, and 3E). This method of injection well completion enabled simultaneous flooding of most of the reserves. State regulatory approval was received to inject down cemented casing.

Injection Surveys 
In a multiple sand waterflood, regularly scheduled injec­tion profiles give information necessary to achieve con­trol of water distribution and improve recovery efficien­cy. An average of 200 radioactive tracer profiles are run annually at Hewitt. Water injection is allocated to in­dividual sands on the basis of these profiles. From the tracer surveys, injection allocations are set for each com­pletion string. Profiles also identify thief zones, stimula­tion candidates, tubing and casing leaks, and channeling between zones. 
Tubing and Packer Installations 
When an imbalance of injection volumes is indicated between zones by well tracer profiles, tubing and packer installations can be used to improve distribution. As shown in Fig. 7, 1 ¼-in. (3.175-cm) tubing and packers are installed in the 2 Ys-in. (7 .3-cm) casing to allow in­jection down the tubing and tubing-casing annulus. This method is applicable only when there is sufficient pressure to inject water into the lower permeability zone. Currently there are 132 tubing and packer installations. These installations have enabled the unit to increase the number of separate injection streams to allow timely flooding of the less permeable producing sands. 
Early profiling in the 1971 expansion area indicated the need for improved distribution. Of the 51 tubing and packer installations in this area, 41, or 80 % , were com­pleted by Jan. 1, 1973, before and during early flood response. Table 2 summarizes the flood results and 1971 expansion area. As shown, the 1971 area projected recovery of 174 bbl/acre-ft (22 427 m3/km2 ·m) is ex­pected to exceed the old area by 19 bbl/acre-ft (2 449 m 3 /km 2 • m). The comparison of flood efficiency is of equal sifnificance. The 1971 area has produced 1 bbl (0.16 m ) of oil per 13.8 bbl (2.2 m3) of injected water, compared with the old area's 1 bbl (0.16 m3) of oil pro­duced per 22 bbl (3.5 m3) of water injected. This dif­ference indicates a more efficient flood in the 1971 ex-
pansion area. We credit a major part of the increased flood efficiency in the expansion area to the early in­stallation of the tubing and packer strings. 
Waterflood Performance Predictions 
Utilizing the injection profiles, an accurate account of in­jection into each sand is recorded to aid in predicting areas of low c.umulative injection throughput and cor­responding high oil saturations. A computer analysis run with the injection data models and predicts injection and production from individual producing sands. The pro­ducing wells have all the sands commingled in the wellbore. Because of the commingled status, oil recovery from any individual sand is virtually impossible to determine, and a prediction of oil recovery potential is made with injection data. 
The computer analysis used at the Hewitt Unit to model waterflood performance is based on articles by Caudle. 1•2 The program provides a simplified model bridging the gap between three-dimensional reservoir simulators and rule-of-thumb prediction techniques. The program assumes steady-state flow, piston displacement, and noncommunicating layers. Within the limitations of the assumptions, the model accounts for areal sweep ef­ficiency, vertical stratification, mobility ratio, initial gas saturation, and changing injectivity. The program output used at Hewitt is a comparison of cumulative injection to cumulative recovery and reserves. These reserve estimates are used to evaluate work programs on injec­tion wells. 
Selective Injection 
Another optimization approach at the Unit has been the selective decrease or increase of injection into individual sands. The purpose of the injection changes is to allocate the injection water optimally into the sands with the highest oil saturation. These injection changes result in larger oil-cut production caused by less water cycling through depleted sands. The water injection cutbacks

prevent a more depleted oil sand from flooding out a less depleted sand in the commingled producing well. Fluid levels are monitored on a regular basis in ali producing wells in the field. The wells with a high fluid level are considered for the possibility of a decrease in offset in­jection. Conversely, low fluid level producers that potentially could benefit from injection increases are identified. The producing sand cumulative throughput of water and corresponding oil reserves are analyzed for the potential of injection changes. 
During 1975 and 1976 several injection cutbacks were used to decrease injection into high water-cut sand_s. The first injection cutback, in Oct. 1975, amounted to 12,000 BID (1908 m3/d) in the Chubbee, and was followed by an increase in production of approximately 200 BOPD (31.8 m3/d oil). The other two injection cutbacks were begun in Sept. and Nov. 1976 and totaled 17,800 BID (2830 m3/d). These injection decreases lowered injec­tion costs while oil production remained unchanged. The decreases in injection did not alter the field decline but successfully lowered fluid levels. Fig. 8 shows produc­tion levels during 1976 following the injection cutback. 
In the second half of 1977 the field decline began to change from a 24 % per year rate to a 1980 decline rate of 12% per year. Selective injection increases were in­itiated in June 1977 and are credited as a principal reason for the gradual shift in field decline. A total increase of 12,250 BWPD (1948 m3 /d water) has been implemented to date. Fig. 9 shows an example of the effect of selec-
tive injection increases into less depleted sands during 1977-80. As shown, the injection increase in Section 15 resulted in increased oil production of as much as 350 BOPD (56 m3/d oil). 
Polymer Treatments 
The Hewitt Unit has had three polymer-augmented injec­tion projects. The projects have involved the injection of a high molecular weight, water-soluble polyacrylamide that becomes gelatinous when mixed with water. A cross-linking agent is injected, and this activates the polyacrylamide to form a viscous gel. The material will enter the most permeable section of the sand and build up yield Strength to block and/or divert flow. The resulting pressure buildup diverts the injection water to less permeable flow channels that are less depleted and con­tain a higher oil saturation. This diversion of injection water improves the vertical sweep efficiency of the flood. 
A map of three polymer project areas is shown in Fig. 10, and a summary of the three projects is presented in Table 3. Each of the projects injected polymer into the Chubbee sand, one of the four major unit sands. Treatments were sized to inject polymer at a 500-ppm concentration for 30 days. The objective was to increase injection wellhead pressure to as near plant injection pressure [1,080 psig (7445 kPa)] as possible while main­taining a constant rate of injection water. This increase in pressure indicates plugging of the most permeable

streaks in the Chubbee sand and corresponding water diversion. 
The polymer projects have been credited with increas­ing tract recovery from a 1972 project high of 32 bbl/acre-ft (4125 m3/km2·m) to a low in 1979 of6.5 bbl/acre-ft (838 m 3 /km2 • m). These figures corresond to 20 to 4% of the 162 bbl/acre-ft (20 881 m3/km f·m) projected unit recovery. 
Producer Stimulation 
Selective stimulation of producing wells has proved a successful method of improving recovery at the Hewitt Unit. Ninety-seven of the 140 active producers have cemented casing strings that permit the selective fractur­ing of a producing sand. The other active producing wells were drilled during primary development and have two or more uncemented liners through the pay interval, prohibiting selective stimulation. An average stimulation workover consists of six stages in four selected intervals in a producing well. The largest stimulation workover consisted of 13 stages in 10 producing intervals. A stan­dard fracture stage consists of 5,000 gal (18.9 m3) of emulsion-based fluid and 8,800 lbm (3992 kg) of sand. 
Seventy-one stimulation jobs have been completed from 1972 to the present. Overall, the 71 stimulation jobs have yielded an average first-year gain of 64 BOPD (10.2 m3/d oil). Thirty-five of the fracture jobs were completed by the end of 1973. Criteria for selecting zones for stimulation include: (1) individual sand quali­ty, (2) individual flood performance in relation to other producers, (3) cumulative and current injection rates by zones in offset inputs, and (4) mechanical condition of the wellbore. 
Artificial Lift Optimization and Selective Testing 
Existing lift equipment does not have the capacity to pump off all the wells in the unit. Fluid levels are monitored and equipment is moved to maximize fluid· production from the higher oil-cut producing sands. 
Individual sands have been tested in 15 producing wells to locate watered-out zones or zones needing stimulation. Intervals are tested individually by isolation with bridge plug and packer. Producing well wireline surveys have not been used at the unit for the following reasons. 
High water-cut production lies outside the accuracy of the tools. 
The fluid level is below more than half of the pro­ducing zones. 
It is difficult to run the tool past the submersible pump. 
Selective testing is expensive in terms of tool rentals, well servicing, and lost production, but the results have shown it to be economical. Selective stimulation treatments of 16 producinŁ zones in 10 wells have yield­ed a 450-BOPD (71.5-m /d) first-year buildup. Addi­tionally, 14 uneconomical zones have been squeeze cemented or blanked off. 
Drilling 
In addition to the 122 wells drilled during the start of waterflood operations, nine producers and three injection replacement wells have been drilled. Seven of the pro­ducing wells were successful, one was marginal, and the ninth well gave very little buildup. Cumulative oil pro­duction as of Jan. 1, 1980, from the nine replacement wells was 2.38 MMbbl (378 390 m3) or approximately 265,000 bbl (42 132 m3) per well. Currently the wells produce 600 BOPD (95.4 m3/d oil) or 67 BOPD (10.7 m 3 Id oil) per well. The three injection inputs were drilled to replace wells with mechanical problems that prevented needed injection distribution. Three of the wells drilled during 1974 and 1976 resulted in an in­crease in producing-tract ultimate recovery. The old pro­ducing wells in these tracts were projected to recover 122 bbl/acre-ft (15 725 m3/km2 ·m). The three new wells resulted in an increase in projected recovery of 45 bbl/acre-ft (5800 m 3 /km2 • m) or a total tract recovery of 167 bbl/acre-ft (21 525 m3/km2 ·m).

The results of replacement well drilling (increased ultimate tract recovery) led to a study of all producing patterns in the unit with more than one producing well. The study results (Table 4) indicated that multiwell pro­ducing patterns are predicted to average 85 bbl/acre-ft (10 956 m3/km2 ·m) greater recovery than single well patterns. The results of this study initially led to five in­fill drilling locations (Fig. 11). 
The five infill wells averaged initial potential of 162 BOPD (25.8 m 3 Id oil) per well. These wells should in­crease tract recovery by an average of 43 bbl/acre-ft (5542 m3 /km2 •m). The infill drilling program has con­tinued in 1980 and 1981 with five and 24 additional wells, respectively. 
Recovery 
The Hewitt Unit is expected to recover 46 MMbbl (7Xl06 m3) of oil through the life of the unit. Table 5 summarizes unit recovery, reflecting 34.9 MMbbl (5 x 106 m3) of additional oil recovery over primary. Without the optimization work programs outlined earlier, the unit would have produced only 41 MMbbl (65 X 106 m3) of oil. The waterflood optimizing methods therefore will yield an additional 5 MMbbl (794 936 m3). 
Conclusions 
The results achieved at the Hewitt Unit waterflood demonstrate the benefits of a thorough surveillance pro­gram and the development of measures to optimize recovery. Early programs to increase recovery included triple-completion injection wells, tubing and packer in-

Recent tech­niques have included the polymer-augmented injection projects and an infill drilling program. These optimiza­tion methods have slowed production decline and in­creased ultimate recovery. Methods used at Hewitt should have application in other waterflood operations.

Answer the following questions one by one. Answer every question independently and it shall not be affected by other questions. DO NOT ignore or omit any questions, ALL questions need to be answered even if you cannot extract. Follow the instruction to answer if you cannot extract. Answer every question only once, and do not repeat the answer multiple times. Ensure every answer is on a separate row. 
We always ask you to answer in the following format: {key:value unit@reference page and reference content}. Please note for some questions, only value exsit, and unit does not exsit. If unit exsit, make sure only one space between the "value" and the "unit". Always output the curly braces, which enclose the answer; do not add punctuation or any extra text outside of the curly braces; and we rely on the curly braces to seperate and parse the answer. Within the curly braces, text before ":" is the key we use to recognize the question. The key should be kept exactly as it is. Text after ":" and before "@" is the value and unit (if exsit) of the key or what we ask you to extract from the papers. Text after "@" is reference page and reference content that let us know where the answer comes from. When user asks "reference page and reference content", user wants to know the reference you used to reasoning about the answer. It is not ask you to output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". Save the reference text (not line numbers) from which you extracted the answer to "reference content"; and save the reference text's page number to "reference page". Make sure to keep the reference text under 60 words, as we have limited output space. Ignore any line breakers in reference text, and output them as a single line. When you cannot extract the answer, please only output as required, which is usually {key:not_mentioned} and do not need to give any explanations. "reference page and reference content" is specific for every question, so work on it every time when you answer a question. 
Here is an example: The reference text says "the Oska field's oil production volume is 23 bbl/day" in page 1  , and user ask what is the Oil production volume for the Oska field? you should answer in the following format: {Oil production volume:23 bbl/day@page 1 the Oska field's oil production volume is 23 bbl/day}. 
This is the start of a question. This question can not be skipped, please answer it. After answering this question, go ahead to answer the next question if it exists.You need to replace reference page and reference content properly as required every time you answer a question and follow all format requirements. Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". According to the above reference text, is downhole pump used in Hewitt Unit? If yes, please answer {Downhole pump:mentioned@Reference page and referece content}. If no, please answer {Downhole pump:not_mentioned}. I'll gvie you a few hints to help you answer better. Hint 1: Please note that there are several types of downhole pumps, such as Rod Pump, Sucker Rod Pump or Electric Submersible Pump (ESP). So they may not mention the text "downhole pump", but they may mention a specific type of downhole pump. Hint 2: Sometimes they mention downhole pump or a type of downhole pump, such as Rod Pump is used in Basin A, and the field B is located in Basin A. You'll need to take extra reasoning steps to figure out that field B uses downhold pump, and answer accordingly.

Refer to the beginning of the prompt for instructions and examples. DO NOT just output the literal string of "reference page and reference content". From the above reference text, does Hewitt Unit oil field adopt water reinjection as a production method for oil or gas exploitation? Please note that water injection for water flooding is not water reinfection, maintaining reservoir pressure is equal to water flooding, not water reinjection is equal to water disposal, water flooding and water reinjection are two completely different ways. please answer {Water reinjection:mentioned@Reference page and content}. Otherwise, please answer {Water reinjection:not_mentioned}.
