0 Designations: DDT= dynamic distillation test, SWID-1 = stagewise isochoric distillation at ramped temperature, SWID-2 = stage isochoric distillation at constant temperature, mSWID-1 = stagewise isochoric distillation with ramped temperature and injection of water, mSWID-2 = modified stagewise isochoric distillation at constant temperature and injection of water. 
b Initial volume of water in the cell. c Initial volume of oil in the cell. d In steam distillation runs where the temperature is ramped, the average temperature and pressure of the runs are process dependent.
