Compositional data has recently been reported18 for simple distillation and laboratory steamfloods of oils in the range 13 -33 °API, including Kern River oil. The current report is an extension of that work to include analyses of produced field samples for the Kern River stearnflood. 
Compositional reservoir simulators demand greater emphasis on obtaining more in-depth crude oil compositional data, to be used as input into an equation-of-state (EOS) or to calculate equilibrium ratios, K-values. The present work establishes laboratory data to facilitate such efforts. 
Laboratory vaporization and steam distillation tests are vital to the understanding of the steamflood mechanism. This partnership of EPTD and TAMU has resulted in the most extensive examination of the steam distillation behavior of one heavy crude oil. Steam distillation of crude oil in petroleum reservoirs has been recognized as one of the major mechanisms responsible for high oil recovery by steam flooding. An appreciable amount of incremental oil19• 20 could be recovered by steam flooding due to steam distillation depending on the composition of the crude oil. The steady growth of commercial thermal recovery projects has created a need for basic data on phase equilibria of water and hydrocarbons ranging from methane to high boiling-point fractions. Current mathematical compositional reservoir simulators use the results of 2-phase flash calculations by equations of state (EDS) or use 2-phase K­value tables to account for hydrocarbon/water/vapor separation. 
Water is ubiquitous in petroleum reservoirs and recovery systems. Therefore, the effects of water on the hydrocarbon separation process are needed by the petroleum industry, for predicting the effects of steam distillation and the phase behavior of hydrocarbon/water systems. Three-phase K-values that account for the effects of steam distillation would be very useful in thennal reservoir simulation studies since they greatly increase the accuracy and reliability of thermal simulators. 
The EDS approach and table look-up for 2-phase K-values are applied in thermal numerical simulation models, even though they do not fully represent 3-phase separation (steam distillation). A three-component system approximation was used by Coats and Smart21 to incorporate steam distillation effects by adding water as a component in the vapor phase. The compositional variations due to steam distillation cannot be fully described by Coats' model. A difficulty in this model is the lack of 3-phase laboratory steam distillation data for high­temperature and high-pressure conditions. Recent work by Beladi,22•23 Wu,24 Lanclos, 25 Forero, 26 and Lolley27'28 has begun to show how to treat this problem. 
The goal of this research is to obtain 3-phase laboratory steam distillation data to better understand the effects of water and its vapor on the hydrocarbon separation processes at high­temperature and high-pressure conditions. This includes the investigation on both the pure hydrocarbon component/water systems and crude oil/water systems. The 3-phase equilibrium ratios or K-values determined from these laboratory investigations are necessary to accurately describe the effects of steam distillation in mathematical reservoir simulation. 
Experimental 
Steam Distillation Cell and Procedures. In order to describe the existing laboratory procedures, Fig. 1 is presented. This experimental set-up was used to perform three different types of tests: 
Static system pressure test (SPT). 
Dynamic distillation test (DDT) 
Stage-wise isochoric distillation test (SWID) 
The experimental apparatus was composed of an injection assembly (Ruska pumps and the gas bottles), a distillation cell assembly, a withdrawal assembly (condenser, separator) and an automation/data acquisition assembly. The steam distillation apparatus has been extensively described elsewhwere.22 
Static system pressure tests (SPT). Static system pressure tests were run for hydrocarbons (HC) in the presence of water phase (3-phase, VLL equilibria) and in absence of water (2-phase, VL equilibria). These tests were performed on every samp]e to obtain the system pressures of HC/ water mixtures, and were used as an indication of equilibrium conditions in distillation tests. It was important to have the static pressure data to insure that equilibrium or near equilibrium conditions are reached for SWID tests. The results of these tests can also be used to tune the EDS approaches. 
Dynamic distillation tests (DDT). Dynamic distillation tests were performed to investigate the effect of steam injection-rate on the steam distillation yields. This testing procedure was primarily used to obtain the maximum steam distillation yield. 
Stage-wise isochoric distillation (SWID) tests. The SWID test is a stage-wise distillation test conducted in a constant volume cell (isochoric). At each stage the system is brought !.Q equilibrium before the distillate sample is removed from the vapor phase. We performed two types of SWID tests: 
SWID-1) This test was conducted under stepwise increase of temperature for each stage. The equilibrium was reached between the stages. After the equilibrium was reached, distillate sample is removed for compositional analysis of the vapor phase. From the volumes of the distillate and the composition of the hydrocarbon phase, the new over-all composition in the cell was calculated by the mole balance. The remaining components with the calculated overall compositions were used for the next stage of test (at a higher temperature). This method was originally reported as the semi-static test. 
SWID-2) This test was conducted at a constant temperature for all stages. Equilibrium is reached between the stages. After equilibrium was reached, distillate sample was removed for compositional analysis of the vapor phase. From the volumes of the distillate and the composition of the hydrocarbon phase, the new over-all composition in the cell was calculated by the mole balance. The remaining components with the calculated overall compositions were used for the next stage of testing (at the same temperature). This was our new test procedure to examine the
