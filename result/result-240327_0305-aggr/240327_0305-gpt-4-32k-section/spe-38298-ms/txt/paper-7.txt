point of 640 °F. This has important implications in the thermal models used in numerical simulation of steamfloods designed for higher temperatures than Kern River. Current trends toward few pseudo components and non-volatile heavy ends may not be adequate to describe the compositional behaviors observed here. It is very clear based on compositional analyses that steam distillation vaporizes heavier and heavier hydrocarbons as the distillation process proceeds. This phenomenon can be verified in other physical properties of the overheads including density, viscosity, and molecular weight. 
Distillate Density Changes During Steam Distillation. The density and viscosity of produced steam distillates were measured where there was sufficient sample. Density is a required measurement for compositional analysis, but because of the small quantity of some samples an alternate method of density analysis using an calibrated syringe was developed for very small samples. The results of both methods are included here for comparison. Viscosity measurements, which usually require at least 2 ml of sample, were measured where possible, and are discussed below. 
The densities of produced samples from the steam distillation of Kern River Station 36 oil at 300 °F show an increase with the amount of steam throughput (Table 4, Fig. 9). This is consistent with the loss of light ends at early times of the distillation and vaporization of heavier ends as the steam distillation proceeds. The densities and viscosities of produced samples from the steam distillation of Kern River Station 36 oil at 400 °F under superheated conditions show a higher increase in density with the amount of steam throughput (Table 4, Fig. 9). This is consistent with the generalized vaporization mechanism discussed above, and with the suppression of vaporization due to the presence of water. The densities of the overheads also go to higher values compared to the distillation at 300 °F. The densities and viscosities of produced samples from the steam distillation of Kem River Station 36 oil at 400 °F under saturated steam conditions show an higher increase in density with the amount of steam throughput (Table 4, Fig. 9). This is consistent with the generalized vaporization mechanism. The densities of produced samples from the variable temperature steam distillation of Kern River oil (SWID-1) also show the trend of increasing density with the amount of steam throughput (Table 4, Fig. 9). 
Rheology of Steam Distillation Effluents. Rheological data on the steam distillation overheads would be useful for tuning computational models of the steam distillation process. The cell size, charge volumes, and experimental procedures used in the experimental setup permitted the collection of sufficient overhead volumes for viscosity measurements. 
Viscosities at three temperatures were measured for distilled hydrocarbon samples from the 300 °F steam distillation Run B07. Ambient temperature viscosities versus steam throughput were measured for overheads from 400 °F superheated and saturated steam distillations, Runs B09 and BIO respectively. 
The results in this section represent the most comprehensive rheological measurements on steam distillation samples from one oil, Kern River oil, under a number of steam distillation conditions. Some ambient temperature viscosity data for steam distillation overheads has been included in Table 4, and viscosities with temperature are summarized in Table 5. 
The general trend of produced distillate viscosity with steam throughput is increasing (Fig. 10). Viscosities of produced distillate samples from the 300 °F steam distillation are included in Fig. 11. To obtain sufficient sample for the viscosity with temperature measurements, the first 8 produced samples were combined into two samples. Overhead samples 0, 1, 2, and 3 were combined as were samples 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Large viscosity changes are to be noted in a comparison of the early distillate sample (B07 0-3) to the late distillate sample (B07 4-8). The viscosity increases by nearly a factor of two, from 3.52 cp to 6.02 cp, at 77°F as the steam distillation proceeded. This observation of increasing viscosity with steam throughput in a steam distillation experiment was suggestive of a possible method to estimate a steamflood life by analysis of the hydrocarbon condensate or •casing blow'. For comparison, the viscosity with temperature results for Kern River condensate are included in Table 5. Based on the absolute viscosity values and the temperature dependence the Kern River condensate appears similar to the production sample at low values of steam throughput. This similarity to early steam distillation samples is also reflected in the density data. In one approach, Kern River has been steamflooded for 20 years, and the condensate would be expected to change. However, it appears to be similar to the first overheads from a steam distillation experiment. It appears that the produced condensate from the field is not directly indicative of the overhead at large steam throughput from a steam distillation experiment. 'Casing blow' condensate produced in the field represents a relatively light hydrocarbon fraction from the overall Kern River oil that does not condense in the steamflood. It may represent only a fraction of the hydrocarbon vaporized in the steamflood process. 
The viscosities of produced distillates from 400 °F steam distillations show similar trends and are summarized in Fig. 11. 
Molecular Weight Changes During Steam Distillation. Molecular weight determinations of condensed steam distillation overheads were measured where possible to corroborate results from compositional, viscosity, and density measurements, and to extend the available information on the character of steam distillation overheads of Kern River oil. The results of molecular weight measurements by freezing point depression (FPD) taken on all the available Kern River Station 36 steam distillation samples are given in Table 6. Samples from steam distillations at 300 °F were not measured. The results are summarized according to sample number, related to steam throughput, to facilitate tabulation. Sample numbers are cross-referenced to steam factors for Runs B09, B 10, and B04 in Table 6. 
The first set of constant temperature results are B09 and
