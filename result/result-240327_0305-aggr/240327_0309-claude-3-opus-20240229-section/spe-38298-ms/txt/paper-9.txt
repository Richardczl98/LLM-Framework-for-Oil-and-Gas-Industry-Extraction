well conditions. 
The vapor phase steam oil ratio on a mass basis could be as low as 10-20 based on laboratory steam distillations. The presence of some hydrocarbon in the steam may affect logging tools that respond to oxygen and carbon densities. 
Superheated steam vaporizes more oil than saturated steam. In comparative runs at 400 "F superheated steam distilled 25% more Kern River oil than saturated steam. This interesting effect noted in previous work probably has little application in the field where superheated steam conditions are unlikely, but could be useful in a surface upgrading technique.
