the estimated steam-hydrocarbon volume ratio in the vapor phase would be in the range of 32-499. 
The two Kern River crude oils appear very similar in their vapor pressure-temperature curves, but AWT #6 oil exhibits a slightly lower pressure at each temperature compared to Station 36 oil. This indicates that AWT #6 oil contains a smaller amount of more volatile components, and is consistent with its higher viscosity (Table 1). 
The predicted boiling points of the oils from the extrapolation of the temperature-pressure lines to 14.696 psia, shows that condensate will boil at > 400 °F. The boiling points of the oils are > 600 "F. These are boiling estimates for one theoretical plate and do not represent the true boiling point (TBP) of the oils. The results are included for future modeling purposes. EOS and K-value approaches should enable modeling of these results. 
Steam Distillation Yields of Kern River Crude Oil. Steam distillation tests yield the amount of oil vaporized by a given amount of steam at certain temperature and pressure conditions. The experiment approaches an equilibrium flash of an oil/water PVT type system, but how close the steam distillation test is to an equilibrium flash is unknown at present. It is currently assumed to be very close. The steam distillation test generally isolates the steam distillation mechanism from all other mechanisms that might be occurring in the steamflood process. Because the distillation mechanism is so isolated by this experiment, the overall results by themselves do not directly relate to a conventional measurable field event, but are related to overall steamflood performance. Specific events within the steam distillation experiment, especially at early steam throughput may provide estimates of composition and water-oil ratio in the vapor phase, useful in certain logging methods of steam zones, and for gross estimates of K-values used for simulation. As more precise instrumental techniques, fluid analyses, and simulation become available, steam distillation results may be better related to the amount and quality of 'casing blow' produced in the steamflood process. 
Steam distillation measurement in the laboratory involves passing steam through an oil phase in a fixed volume cell at a certain temperature and pressure. Steam distillation experiments can be conducted under saturated or superheated steam conditions. The steam distillation experiment can be run dynamically (DDT) or stage-wise (SWID). TAMU has developed the stage-wise isochoric (constant volume) distillation (SWID) method and variations. Briefly, in the constant volume SWID procedure oil and pure water are equilibrated at test temperature and pressure conditions. A sample of vapor is then removed and condensed, and the condensed phases are measured and analyzed. The condensed phases consist of water and a light hydrocarbon distillate or overhead. In a modified SWID, after vapor removal, additional water may be injected into the cell to replace the water produced. The sampling cycle is continued after re-equilibration of the water and oil. The 
temperature may be held constant throughout the experiment (SWID Type 2) or it can be changed between sampling cycles (SWID Type l). 
In the steam distillation tests the initial Kern River Station 36 oil volume for most tests was 500 cc in a 2000 cc temperature controlled distillation cell. In some cases, water was initially present in the cell and in some cases there was no water initially present. The water injection rate in dynamic steam distillation tests was l cc/min (nominal), where applicable. The steam distillation conditions of the dynamic (DDT) and stagewise isochoric distillation (SWID l and 2 type) tests conducted with Kem River oil are summarized in Table 2. Complete details of the experimental results have been given elsewhere.23 
Six isothermal steam distillations, which include SWID-2 and DDT types, were conducted using Kern River oil. Two steam distillation runs were completed at 300 "F (Runs B07 and B08) and two distillation were completed at 400 "F (Runs B09 and B 10). One run (B02) was conducted at 467 "F, and one run (BBR3) was completed at 500 °F. 
Four variable temperature steam distillations, SWID-1 type, were completed with Kern River oil. Runs B04, B05, and B12 were initiated at 300 °F, and the temperature was increased after each overhead withdrawal. In most cases water was initially in contact with the oil. One other variable temperature run (SWID I), B13, commenced at 400 "F. 
The amounts of oil produced (steam distillation yield) at the final steam throughput (steam factor) are summarized in Table 3 for each of the steam distillation runs with Kern River oil. Kern River Station 36 oil was distillable under all test conditions. The maximum oil yield due to steam was >15% in a 400 °F isothermal steam distillation run (B09) with a 3.543 steam factor. The 300 °F runs, B07 and B08, had lower yields. Variable temperature (SWID-1) runs show appreciable yields at lower steam throughput. 
The oil production curves for steam distillation experiments conducted at 300 °F (Fig. 3a) show a steam distillation yield as high as I0% of the initial oil at a steam distillation factor of 4.599. The two runs, conducted with slightly different experimental procedures, have different yield curves. The only similarity is in the production at the beginning of the steam distillation, after that, the curves diverge. Run B07 was conducted in modified dynamic mode (mSWID-2) with water injected in a batch-wise mode after each depletion. Run B08 was conducted as a dynamic distillation with water injection and vapor production occurring continuously. The differences in yields appear to be a function of this process. The higher production curve and overall yield of the dynamic test (B08) may be the result of more efficient mixing and equilibration of water/oil/steam. 
Process effects are presented by examining the difference in yield profile of mSWID-2 (B07) as compared to the dynamic Run B08. Both processes were performed at 300 °F, but the means of injection and production was varied. The mSWID-2 injection and production were done in a batch manner. This test was performed at a condition expected to be closer to
