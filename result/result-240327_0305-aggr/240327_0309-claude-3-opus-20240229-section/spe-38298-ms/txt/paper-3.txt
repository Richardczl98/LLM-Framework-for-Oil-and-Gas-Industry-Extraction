compositional effects on the K-values. 
In SWID tests (SWID-1 or SWID-2), after each stage of equilibrium, the overhead samples including hydrocarbon and water vapors were withdrawn from the vapor phase and were condensed. The hydrocarbons were separated from the water and their volumes are measured. The HC sample was collected for chromatography analysis. 
Compositional analysis by gas chromatography. Gas chromatographic analysis was conducted in two ways. Heavy oil analysis is generally done using a specially modified simulated distillation technique to accurately account for heavy ends that do not elute during analysis. In this method the chromatograph retention time is calibrated versus n-alkane carbon number, and the absolute response on a mass basis is calibrated by comparison with an external standard, a I 00% eluted light crude oil. Because the oil mixtures are thick, the oil samples had to be cut with carbon disulfide (CS2) before introduction into the GC. This latter procedure effectively imposes an addition correction for the CS2 diluent. 
Simple oil characterization. Densities were measured with a DMA 48 densitometer. In cases where the sample size was not sufficient for electronic density measurement, a calibrated ÂµL syringe was used. 
Molecular weights were determined by vapor pressure osmometry (VPO) using tetrahydrofuran solvent, and/or freezing point depression (FPD) using para-xylene solvent. 
Vapor Pressure Data. Vapor pressure measurements on Kern River fluids were made using an isoteniscope. The standard method used by Phoenix Chemical Labs was ASTM D -2388.29 The results are related to the phase envelope of the mixture, and are probably close to the bubble point curve of the mixture. 
Results and Discussion 
In conventional gas/oil reservoirs the reservoir is defined not only by the reservoir matrix but also by the fluids contained within the rock. As the reservoir is produced the reservoir pressure and temperature, and the composition of the fluids change. These changes are studied in phase behavior studies and are necessary for estimating the performance of the reservoir. For heavy oil reservoirs under steamflood some analogous but different behavior is taking place. The injection of steam is placing a gas, water vapor, in the reservoir, and the temperature and pressure of the reservoir are changing. Although there are exceptions,. most heavy oil reservoirs prior to steam injection contain water and hydrocarbon in the liquid phase. There is little or no gas cap or vapor space. As the steamflood matures, oil and water are heated, removed from the reservoir and a steamchest forms. In a mature steamflood, like Kern River, steam has broken through to the production wells. At the production well, liquid phase oil and a vapor phase called 'casing blow' are often produced. The 'casing 
blow' is composed of water, a light hydrocarbon condensate, and non-condensible gas. The production of hydrocarbon condensate is the clearest evidence that compositional changes are occurring in the steamflood process. To fully access the overall performance of a reservoir under steamflood the pressure, temperature, and hydrocarbon compositional changes need to be accounted for. To include compositional changes in the reservoir model of a steamflood requires generating PVT like properties for heavy oil, a somewhat oxymoronic concept. Traditional PVT studies measure bubble points, etc1 to generate EOS parameters for prediction and modeling purposes, but researchers have been loathe to conduct studies using heavy oil and water. For heavy oils under steamflood, other properties may be measured to gain access to PVT type data. In the approach proposed here, oil vapor pressure data are expected to be related to the phase envelope of the oil and the boiling point, and steam distillation data should yield information about water/oil interactions. 
The hydrocarbons used in the present study were: water-free Kern River condensate, AWT #6 oil, Station 36 oil. The Kern River condensate and oils were obtained from the field, and where necessary were dewatered by vacuum distillation. The properties of the oils are summarized in Table 1. Station 36 oil is generally accepted as an average produced oil from the Kem River field. Extensive steam distillation experiments were conducted with Station 36 oil. The other fluids are included to get an idea of the vapor-liquid-equilibria (VLE) that may exist for these systems. Vapor pressure measurements were made on the three samples of Table I. Steam distillation studies including compositional analysis were carried out with Station 36 oil. 
Vapor Pressure Measurements. The pressure of the vapor exerted by a crude oil is useful in the development of an equation-of-state, and in making estimates of the gross vapor composition of the steamchest in terms of a vapor phase steam-oil ratio. It is also strategic to the understanding of the steam distillation mechanism. Vapor pressure measurements, although strictly defined for a single component fluid, can be performed on mixtures of components like crude oils. 
The vapor pressure was determined on three samples of Kern River fluids. Measurements commenced at room temperature and were continued up to nearly 14.7 psia (Fig. 2). The temperature at which the oil reaches a pressure of 14.696 psia is related to the simple boiling point of the mixture in a one plate boiling apparatus. 
At 100 "F the fluids have negligible pressures; condensate has a pressure of 0.04 psia and the two crude oil pressures are < 0.002 psia. At 300 "F the pressures are higher; the condensate pressure is > 3.0 psia and the oil pressures are -0.2 psia. As a consequence, for a steam system temperature of 300 "F, the hydrocarbons may contribute 0.2-3.0 psia to the total system pressure. Saturated steam at 300 "F exerts a pressure of 67 psia. Under ideal gas law conditions, a saturated steam-Kem River hydrocarbon system would be expected to exhibit a total system pressure between 67.2 and 70 psia. Under these same conditions
