Conclusions 
By applying waterflooding surveillance literature plots in Tiguino field, it was possible not only to describe the kind of reservoir, but also to keep the reservoir water cut up for a longer period of time in comparison with the whole life of the IOR project. 
The enhanced pore volumes injected plot was a powerful tool not only to identify the water cut behavior but also to have a better visualization of the suitable injection patterns for the reservoir. 
The oil cut versus Np plot, which was very useful for visualizing and monitoring the results achieved in Tiguino field, could be applied to any IOR project worldwide. 
The initial application monitored in Ecuador will be able to be considered as a first approach for starting an IOR optimization in similar stratified reservoirs worldwide. 
The results obtained in Tiguino field are helpful not only as a real example but also as a statistical support for a cyclic waterflooding technique.
