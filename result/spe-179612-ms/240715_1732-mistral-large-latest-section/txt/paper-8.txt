Figure 9—Lower Napo T depositional environmets scheme (Allen (1991), Dalrymple et al, (1991) and Pritchard (1967) 
To the east of the field are located the fluvial facies of Lower Napo T reservoir and to the west the stuarine facies ((<>)Fig. 10). 
Figure 10—TIG 11WIW, TIG 12WIW, TIG 08 and TIG 06 stratigraphic cross section 
In (<>)Fig. 10 it is possible to observe the gamma ray log responses according to the depositional environments sheme (channels, bars). It is also seen that the Lower Napo T reservoir in the producers Tiguino 12 and Tiguino 08 has a clean main sand body, while towards the top, develops interbedded sandstones and shales.
