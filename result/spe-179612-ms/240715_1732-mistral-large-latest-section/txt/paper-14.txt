WOR vs. Np well response 
During Tiguino 05WIW shut in, Tiguino 01HZ, Tiguino 02ST, and Tiguino 06HZ wells showed a WOR downward trend. (<>)Fig. 17 illustrates the WOR vs Np plot for Tiguino 06HZ well.

Phase 3 Reservoir results after Tiguino 05WIW shut in 
The last part of Tiguino case analysis was carried out between January 17, 2015 (when Tiguino 05WIW returned to its steady water injection conditions) and August 31, 2015 (when the IOR project was last monitored). 
Oil Cut vs Np 
In order to have a better visualization of the results, that not only occurred after Tiguino 05WIW shut in but also during the entire IOR project, it is not neccesarily to look further than the Oil Cut versus Np plot ((<>)Fig. 18).
