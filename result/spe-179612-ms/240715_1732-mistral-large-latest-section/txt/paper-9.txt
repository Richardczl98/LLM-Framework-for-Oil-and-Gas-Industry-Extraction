Water injection geological characterization 
Lower Napo T reservoir in Tiguino 05WIW and Tiguino 11WIW injector wells has no basal clean body and only interbedded sand and shale layers ((<>)Fig. 11). 
Figure 11â€”Waterflooding injection scheme 
The upward and lateral appearance of interbedded sandstones and shales is related to facies evolution, from more proximal to more distal, or lateral from estuarine channels to sand and shale plains. This facies evolution, as was showed before ((<>)Fig. 10), produces the deteriorating of reservoir properties in the same direction. It is important to mention that in the transitional environments there is glauconite, described in some wells located at the west part of the field (Gurpreet S. and Wai Ma, 2003). 
Given this, it was possible to confirm that Lower Napo T reservoir, has been behaving as a stratified reservoir. 
Tiguino case study description 
The Tiguino case study is focused on explaining the events and responses observed before, during and after the 5 month shut in event of Tiguino 05WIW. Therefore the following case description has been divided in three phases. It is important to remember that Tiguino case involves Lower and Basal Napo T reservoirs, and that the majority of the producer wells has perforated intervals in Lower Napo T reservoir. As was exposed before (see (<>)Fig. 11), the first injector well in the field was Tiguino 05WIW, which has perforated intervals in both Lower and Basal Napo T reservoir. The other injector well, Tiguino 11WIW, has perforated intervals only in Lower Napo T reservoir.
