Figure 8â€”Oriente Basin cretaceous stratigraphic sequences and reservoirs 
Stratigraphic Napo T unit is a third order upper Albian genetic sequence, and is developed between the maximum flooding surfaces of C and B Limestones. This genetic sequence contains T reservoir which is usually divided in two reservoirs which are Upper T and Lower T. 
The base of T reservoir is generally erosive. In the east and central part of Oriente Basin this marked a maximum regression along with an erosion which could affect T limestone and, in some cases, it can reach the basal Napo shale by creating incised valleys ((<>)Fig. 8), in which, with the raise of sea level, Basal T sandstone is deposited (as defined by (<>)PetroCanada, 1987). 
Lower Napo T and Basal T stratigraphy 
Lower Napo T reservoir is developed over an erosive surface, or over the Basal T sandstone (where it appears). Generally it has the best reservoir properties. In Tiguino Field, it is a sandstone with fine grain, varying sometimes to medium. It is deposited in fluvial and tide influenced estuarine environments, represented by fluvial and tidal channels and bars ((<>)Fig. 9).
