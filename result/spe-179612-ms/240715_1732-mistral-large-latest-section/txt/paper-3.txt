Lower Napo T reservoir is one of the main producing reservoirs of Tiguino Field. The oil production of this reservoir started in 1990 with the well Tiguino 04. In May 2006 an Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) project started through water injection by converting the producer well Tiguino 05. Later in July 2009, the producer well Tiguino 11 was also changed to an injector well. In September 2014 there were 9 active wells that had been producing from this reservoir, which were the Tiguino 01HZ, Tiguino 02ST, Tiguino 04, Tiguino 06HZ, Tiguino 08, Tiguino 12, Tiguino 13HST2, Tiguino 17 and Tiguino 20 wells. From these 9 wells, the wells that showed direct responses to the waterflooding project were all of them with an exception of Tiguino 04 and Tiguno 20. (<>)Fig. 2 shows the location of all Lower Napo T wells in the base structural map along with the water cut values of the 7 IOR response wells.

Oil production 
The average oil production of the 5 current active wells during 2015 was 1,194 BOPD. This production represents 49% of the total oil production of the field. 
Drive mechanism and Pr 
The drive mechanism of Lower Napo T reservoir has been defined as a combination of liquid and rock expansion and solution gas drive ((<>)Fig. 3). This drive mechanism was also confirmed with the reservoir pressure drop ((<>)Fig. 4). Once the waterflooding project through Tiguino 05WIW started, the reservoir pressure of Lower Napo T was maintained. Once Tiguino 11WIW was added to waterflooding project, the reservoir pressure started to increase.
