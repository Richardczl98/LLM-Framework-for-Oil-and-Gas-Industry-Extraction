Figure 7—TIG 01 and TIG 05WIW stratigraphic cross section 
Based on the better properties observed in Basal T reservoir in Tiguino 05WIW, it is more likely that the tracer arrival observed in Tiguino 01HZ come from this body. Nevertheless, the injection contribution of Lower Napo T reservoir in Tiguino 05WIW, despite its poor properties, are not dismissed. It is important to remember that Tiguino 11WIW was joined to waterflooding project just 7 days after the tracer was injected in Tiguino 05WIW. 
Lower Napo T Reservoir – Geological Description 
Cretaceus stratigraphic units, and reservoirs in Oriente basin 
The Cretaceous section of the Oriente basin, consists of Hollin and Napo formations and the Basal Tena sandstone, which can be divided into several genetic sequences ((<>)Rivadeneira, M., Almeida, P., 2014), among which are all known reservoirs: Hollín, T, U, M1, and Basal Tena ((<>)Fig. 8).
