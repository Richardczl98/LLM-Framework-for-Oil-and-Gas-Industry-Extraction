Lukoil has approved development of Rakushechnoye oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea off Russia.

The company plans a fixed, ice-resistant platform, a quarters platform, a crossover bridge, and subsea interfield pipelines and cable lines connected with a second fixed platform at V. Filanovsky field 8.5 km away (OGJ Online, June 18, 2018).

Lukoil expects Rakushechnoye commercial production to start in 2023 and reach a plateau rate of 1.2 million tonnes/year.

Discovered in 2001, the field is in 5-8 m of water 100 km from Russiaâ€™s west coast and 160 km from the port of Astrakhan.

Lukoil estimates recoverable reserves at 39 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 33 billion cu m of natural gas.
