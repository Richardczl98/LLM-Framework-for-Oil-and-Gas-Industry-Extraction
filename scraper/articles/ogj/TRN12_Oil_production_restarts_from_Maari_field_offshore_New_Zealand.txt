Title:
Oil production restarts from Maari field offshore New Zealand

Content:
OMV Group’s Maari oil field in the Taranaki basin offshore New Zealand’s north island is being progressively brought back on stream this week.

The field was shut in November 2016 after a crack was found on one of the four-legged steel platform’s 12 horizontal struts during a scheduled inspection (OGJ Online, Nov. 28, 2016).

An interim repair of three clamps installed on the strut has enabled a gradual resumption of oil production from the field.

At the time of shutdown, Maari-Manaia field was producing 10,000 b/d of oil from 10 producing wells. The wells are being reinstated in “a controlled and phased manner,” partner Horizon Oil International Ltd. reported. “Initial production is likely to be enhanced somewhat due to natural pressure build-up, which will accelerate recovery of the production,” Horizon said.

OMV says two options for a permanent solution are now being investigated and the permanent repair will be completed by midyear.

OMV says the temporary fix has been approved by its insurers as well as government regulators.

Maari lies 80 km offshore in 100 m of water.

The field was discovered in 1983 and was brought on stream in 2009.

Maari is operated by OMV New Zealand Ltd., 69%, on behalf of the Maari joint venture, which includes Todd Maari Ltd. 16%, Horizon Oil 10%, and Cue Taranaki Pty. Ltd. 5%.
