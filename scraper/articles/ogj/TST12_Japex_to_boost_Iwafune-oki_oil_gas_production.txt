LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24 -- Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (Japex) next month will begin operating a new production well at its Iwafune-oki oil and gas field off Niigata Prefecture.

The firm is reinforcing a well drilled to a level deeper than the producing geological formation and has connected the well to existing production facilities.

Production volumes will be increased from February, with the new well expected to add some 120,000 cu m/day of gas and 48 kl/day of oil to current output.

Japex currently produces 500,000 cu m/day of gas and 350 kl/day of oil from the field.

Oil and gas exploration also will begin in late February at an untapped field south of Iwafune-oki.
