HOUSTON, Jan. 26 -- Albania’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Energy formally approved development of Delvina gas-condensate field in southern Albania.

The approval allows Stream Oil & Gas Ltd., Calgary, to enhance production and sell petroleum products under state Albpetrol’s existing license for 25 years with 5-year extension increments.

Delvina, near the border with Greece and 100 miles south of Tirana, was discovered in 1987.

Two wells yield a combined 700 Mcfd of gas and 47 bbl/MMcf of 62.5° gravity condensate from fractured Cretaceous-Paleogene carbonates at 2,800-3,500 m. A pipeline connects the field to a refinery in the Tirana area.

Stream’s 2011 plan includes reworking the two existing wells and preparing to drill a horizontal well. Management is preparing to evaluate NGL potential upside, future horizontal well plans, and NGL development.
