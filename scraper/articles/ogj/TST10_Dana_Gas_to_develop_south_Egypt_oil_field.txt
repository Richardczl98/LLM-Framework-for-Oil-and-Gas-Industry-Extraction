HOUSTON, Jan. 11 -- Dana Gas of the UAE said it will develop an oil field in the Komombo basin 400 miles south of Cairo.

Meanwhile, the Al Baraka-4 appraisal well tapped the Six Hills E reservoir and flowed at a rate of 220 b/d of oil as Al Baraka field’s first well to produce by natural flow, the private sector company said.

Dana Gas said the Al Baraka-4 well is on production at a rate more than five times the sustained producing rate from any previous well in the field, without giving figures. Total depth is 1,470 m.

Al Baraka-4, 470 m southwest of Al Baraka-2, cut 16 m of net oil pay in the field’s previously defined reservoirs and 8 m in the Six Hills “E.” Before being placed on natural flow, the well was tested at a maximum rate of 1,300 b/d of oil on artificial lift.

The volume of reserves discovered is under evaluation, Dana Gas said. While proceeding to develop the field, Dana Gas will continue with its exploration program to explore the entire Komombo concession.
