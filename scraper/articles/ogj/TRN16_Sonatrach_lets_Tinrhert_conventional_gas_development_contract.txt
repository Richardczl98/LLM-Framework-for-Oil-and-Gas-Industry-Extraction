Sonatrach SPA has let an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract to Petrofac for the Tinrhert EPC2 conventional gas development project onshore Algeria.

The aim of this project is to boost output at Ohanet and Alrar through tie-in of peripheral fields to underused processing facilities. The EPC2 contract will provide a new central processing facility (CPF) with inlet separation and decarbonization units. The scope of work also includes tie-ins to the existing Alrar separation and boosting facilities along with commissioning, start-up and performance testing.

When completed, the development will boost natural gas production and remove CO2 from the fieldâ€™s gas reserves, within specifications for the global market, enabling further economic growth in-country.

The contract is valued at about $200 million.

The development lies in Ohanet II block (234p, 239p, 240p, 244p), about 1,500 km southeast of Algiers in Alrar, and comprises seventeen wet gas fields. Individual fields are small and geographically dispersed, requiring tie-ins through the Tinrhert development. Gas, condensate, and LPG is processed at Ohanet and Tamadanet where it enters the national pipeline network. In-place gas is estimated at 5.8 tcf.

Development expansion is currently in the construction stage. Start-up is expected in 2023.

Sonatrach owns and operates Tinrhert field.
