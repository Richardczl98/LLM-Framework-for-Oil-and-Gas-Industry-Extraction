AMEC and joint venture partner Colt Engineering, have been awarded the Front End Design (FED) Stage 3 engineering studies for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project Upstream Expansion.

The 100,000 bbl/day mine expansion consists of crushing, conveying, slurry conditioning, extraction facilities and froth treatment as well as associated infrastructure and utilities located on Shell's Lease 13 approximately 75 kilometers north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. 

The contract follows from the award in January for the Front End Design Stage 2 of the contract to AMEC and reinforces AMEC's position as an industry leader in Canadian upstream oil sands. 

"Our team has worked on almost every mineable lease in northern Alberta, and through a combination of experience and knowledge, are able to provide unsurpassed expertise in this field," says Doug Annable, President of the Energy & Mining business unit. "We are pleased to continue working with Shell and assisting with this major new expansion to their oil sands business." 

"AMEC has a seven year history with Shell in oil sands mining, dating back to our involvement in the original Muskeg River Mine in 1998", said Doug. "We are the natural choice for this project." 

Stage 3 front end design for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project Upstream Expansion started in late June 2005, and is scheduled for completion in April 2006, with a peak of over 200 engineers, designers and project services staff located in the Calgary office. 

The owners of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project may elect to use the AMEC-Colt joint venture for the implementation phase of the work, scheduled to commence in 2006, with first oil production planned for 2009.
