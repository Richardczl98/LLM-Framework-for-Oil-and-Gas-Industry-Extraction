OSLO, March 2 (Reuters) â€“ Knarr, a small field offshore Norway, is expected to start delivering gas to the St Fergus terminal in Britain via a new pipeline link tied to the FLAGS pipeline this spring, gas system operator Gassco said on Monday.
Knarr, a gas and oil field about 100 kilometres (62.14 miles) north of the Statfjord field in the North Sea, is operated by BG, and estimated to hold 72 million barrels of oil and 300 million cubic metres (mcm) of natural gas in recoverable reserves.
Gassco said it would operate the 106 km long pipeline link which will have a capacity to deliver 1.7 mcm of gas per day.
