StatoilHydro has received consent from the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway to use the semsisub Transocean Searcher to conduct drilling and completion operations on six production wells on the Gjøa field.
 
Gjøa is a gas and oil field located about 65 kilometers southwest of Florø, about 45 kilometers west of Sognefjorden and 70 kilometers northeast of Troll B. StatoilHydro is the operator for the development phase, while Gaz de France will assume operatorship when production starts. The water depth at Gjøa is about 360 meters.
 
The six wells will be drilled and completed prior to production start-up in the course of the autumn of 2010.

Transocean Searcher (formerly Ross Isle) is of the Bingo 3000 design, built in 1983. The rig is operated by Transocean Offshore North Sea Ltd NUF. Following modifications, Transocean Searcher is equipped to complete subsea wells and is designed to operate in the North Sea all year round at depths of 60m to 450m. The rig received an Acknowledgement of Compliance (AoC) in December 2003.
