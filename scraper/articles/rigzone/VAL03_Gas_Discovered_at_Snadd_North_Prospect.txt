Gas deposits were discovered in the Snadd North prospect through exploration well 6507/5-6ST2, near the Skarv gas and oil field. Drilled by the 
 semisub, the well confirmed the existence of sandstones saturated with high methane natural gas in the early Cretaceous Lysing formation. It is estimated the recoverable reserves of Snadd North are 57 to 100 Mboe. The well was drilled to a total depth of 2,876 meters, and ended in the early Cretaceous Lange formation. The find, located in PL 212, will be developed in 2011 from the new Skarv platform, which will increase Skarv's future production rates. The Skarv oil and gas field is located in the Norwegian North Sea, roughly 77 miles (200 kilometers) west of Sandnessjoen, Alstahaug, Norway. BP operates the license, owning a 30% interest.
